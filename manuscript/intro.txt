# Introduction

I've long been fascinated by robots; in high school, I participated in
a FIRST robotics team that left a lasting imprint on my engineering
career. However, since then, I'd never gotten around to building a
robot.

Last month, I finally started building one which I hope this is the
predecessor of a number of future robots. This is a writeup of the 
project, written as the robot is worked on. My intention is that this
serves two roles:

1. The main role is to serve as a braindump and knowledge store for
   future robotics endeavours for myself.
2. This may be useful for others building robots.

The robot itself is a platform for learning autonomous navigation; as of
yet, it has no payload to speak of---no mission besides driving around
and not running into obstacles. Eventually it should be able to receive
some sort of objective and be able to arrive, preferably via a radio
link.

Now, I need to actually finish this thing.
